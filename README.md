# HttpDigestAuthCrack
Not actually a crack. Calculates the correct responses necessary for HTTP Digest Authentication MD5 'auth'.

The gathering portion is best done by sniffing packets or MITM between you and the server.

I tested this out on an AXIS camera, but it should work on anything using the correct order or params.
